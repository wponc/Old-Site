        <h1>Career Objectives</h1>
        <p>I am dedicated to the field of data science and particularly motivated by any opportunity to utilize high powered computational tools to ensure environmental
            conservation. Of specific interest to me is the application of geographic information systems to analyze satellite and aerial imagery to inform 
           policy decisions. In my career, I aim to combine UAV photogrammetry with machine learning models to automate environmental assessment and protection protocols. 
           I hope to apply these methods in the growing fields of precision turfgrass management and precision forestry.</p>

        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <h2>Esri&emsp;♢&emsp;May 2023 -</h2>
        <p>This summer, I have the awesome opportunity to intern on the Education & Support Services team at Esri. As the global leaders in 
            GIS software, Esri has a wide variety of customer use-cases in nearly every industry of our data-driven world. As such, powerful software
            requires a dedicated, knowledgeable, and compassionate support group. This summer I'll be assisting the full time analysts in their casework, helping out with research and 
            defect troubleshooting anywhere I can. I will also be compiling this summer's experiences into a comprehensive final project of geospatial 
            analysis across numerous platforms, a link will be posted here upon completion.  
        </p>

        <h2>Virginia Tech SPES&emsp;♢&emsp;May 2022 - May 2023</h2>
        <p>Over the past year I was very fortunate to work as an undergraduate research assistant in the Virginia Tech Turfgrass Pathology Lab, exploring novel applications of technology to traditional
            turf management methodologies. I participated in research on nematode sampling, surface uniformity testing, and other efforts to improve the user experience 
            on golf courses and athletic facilities. I also completed a project investigating the viability of Blue Grama as a low-maintenance choice for lawns in the transition zone.  
            A research poster for some of this work is available

        <h2>SKTWorks LLC&emsp;♢&emsp;September 2021 -</h2>
        <p>Since 2021, I've also had the chance as intern fieldwork assistant at an amazing family-owned land conservation firm. 
            For the role I’ve been able to travel extensively throughout the state of Virginia, conducting site visits to assess land protection 
            practices in the establishment of conservation easements. Much of this experience has involved capture of aerial imagery with UAVs, 
            collection of detailed photopoint information in ArcGIS Field Maps, and contribution to baseline documentation reports. I've also 
            contributed to our newly redesigned website, take a look at the services our firm offers <a href="https://sktworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="ext">here</a>.</p>

        <h1>Personal</h1>
        <p>Haloes! Haleskarth! I'm an FAA-licensed remote pilot skilled in data science and visualization, slowly learning the basics of web design. 
            When I'm not pretending to be busy in front of a computer or flying a drone, I enjoy weightlifting and playing soccer. Dogs are my favorite animal,
            Liverpool is the best team in Europe, and I fully support pineapple on pizza.</p>
